Here we present an efficient, flexible statistical method, diCal2, that can utilize whole-genome sequence data from multiple populations to infer complex demographic models involving population size changes, population splits, admixture, and migration. Applying our method to data from Australian, East Asian, European, and Papuan populations, we find that the population ancestral to Australians and Papuans started separating from East Asians and Europeans about 100,000 years ago, and that the separation of East Asians and Europeans started about 50,000 years ago, with pervasive gene flow between all pairs of populations.},

	Abstract = {The increased availability of time series genetic variation data from experimental evolution studies and ancient DNA samples has created new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. However, it is a challenging problem to compute the likelihood of non-neutral models for the population allele frequency dynamics, given the observed temporal DNA data. Here, we develop a novel spectral algorithm to analytically and efficiently integrate over all possible frequency trajectories between consecutive time points. This advance circumvents the limitations of existing methods which require fine-tuning the discretization of the population allele frequency space when numerically approximating requisite integrals. Furthermore, our method is flexible enough to handle general diploid models of selection where the heterozygote and homozygote fitness parameters can take any values, while previous methods focused on only a few restricted models of selection. We demonstrate the utility of our method on simulated data and also apply it to analyze ancient DNA data from genetic loci associated with coat coloration in horses. In contrast to previous studies, our exploration of the full fitness parameter space reveals that a heterozygote-advantage form of balancing selection may have been acting on these loci.},

@article{Bhaskar2015,
	Abstract = {With the recent increase in study sample sizes in human genetics, there has been growing interest in inferring historical population demography from genomic variation data. Here, we present an efficient inference method that can scale up to very large samples, with tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals. Specifically, by utilizing analytic results on the expected frequency spectrum under the coalescent and by leveraging the technique of automatic differentiation, which allows us to compute gradients exactly, we develop a very efficient algorithm to infer piecewise-exponential models of the historical effective population size from the distribution of sample allele frequencies. Our method is orders of magnitude faster than previous demographic inference methods based on the frequency spectrum. In addition to inferring demography, our method can also accurately estimate locus-specific mutation rates. We perform extensive validation of our method on simulated data and show that it can accurately infer multiple recent epochs of rapid exponential growth, a signal that is difficult to pick up with small sample sizes. Lastly, we use our method to analyze data from recent sequencing studies, including a large-sample exome-sequencing data set of tens of thousands of individuals assayed at a few hundred genic regions.},

	the method in two example applications. First, we estimate selection
	coefficients acting on the CCR5-{\^I}''32 mutation on the basis of published
	samples of contemporary and ancient human DNA. We show that the data
	are compatible with the assumption of s = 0, although moderate amounts
	of selection acting on this mutation cannot be excluded. In our second
	example, we estimate the selection coefficient acting on a mutation
	segregating in an experimental phage population. We show that the

@article{Coop2012,
	Abstract = {Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral alleles
	result from resampling of finite populations (genetic drift) and
	the random genetic background of nearby selected alleles on which
	the neutral alleles are found (linked selection). There is now good
	evidence that linked selection plays an important role in shaping
	polymorphism levels in a number of species. One of the best-investigated
	models of linked selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in
	which newly arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk
	of selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be destined
	for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of recurrent
	selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that generalizes
	the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where selected alleles
	do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a large population, only
	the initial rapid increase of a selected allele affects the genealogy
	at partially linked sites, which under fairly general assumptions
	are unaffected by the subsequent fate of the selected allele. We
	also apply the theory to a simple model to investigate the impact
	of recurrent partial sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find
	that for a given reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent
	partial sweeps on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined
	primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected alleles.
	Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low frequencies
	can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but can leave the
	frequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact, the limiting
	coalescent model under a high rate of sweeps to low frequency is
	identical to the standard neutral model. The general model of selective
	sweeps we describe goes some way toward providing a more flexible
	framework to describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently
	available.},

	Abstract = {Migrations have played an important role in shaping the genetic diversity
	of human populations. Understanding genomic data thus requires careful
	modeling of historical gene flow. Here we consider the effect of
	relatively recent population structure and gene flow and interpret
	genomes of individuals that have ancestry from multiple source populations
	as mosaics of segments originating from each population. This article
	describes general and tractable models for local ancestry patterns
	with a focus on the length distribution of continuous ancestry tracts
	and the variance in total ancestry proportions among individuals.
	The models offer improved agreement with WrightFisher simulation
	data when compared to the state-of-the art and can be used to infer
	time-dependent migration rates from multiple populations. Considering
	HapMap African-American (ASW) data, we find that a model with two
	distinct phases of European gene flow significantly improves the
	modeling of both tract lengths and ancestry variances.},

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>The demographic history of our species
	is reflected in patterns of genetic variation within and among populations.
	We developed an efficient method for calculating the expected distribution
	of genetic variation, given a demographic model including such events
	as population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration.
	We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data,
	searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our
	joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations
	yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular,
	we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000
	years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because
	our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be
	important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data.
	We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations
	to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence
	for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations
	diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we

	Abstract = {We present an implementation of a recently introduced method for estimating
	the allele-frequency spectrum under the diffusion approximation.
	For single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency data from multiple
	populations, the method computes numerical solutions to the allele-frequency
	spectrum (AFS) under a complex model that includes population splitting
	events, migration, population expansion, and admixture. The solution
	to the diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) that mimics
	the evolutionary process is found by means of truncated polynomial
	expansions. In the absence of gene flow, our computation of frequency
	spectra yields exact results. The results are compared to those that
	use a finite-difference method and to forward diffusion simulations.
	In general, all the methods yield comparable results, although the
	polynomial-based approach is the most accurate in the weak-migration
	limit. Also, the economical use of memory attained by the polynomial
	expansions makes the study of models with four populations possible
	for the first time. The method was applied to a four-population model
	of the human expansion out of Africa and the peopling of the Americas,
	using the Environmental Genome Project (EGP) SNP database. Although
	our confidence intervals largely overlapped previous analyses of
	these data, some were significantly different. In particular, estimates
	of migration among African, European, and Asian populations were
	considerably lower than those in a previous study and the estimated
	time of migration out of Africa was earlier. The estimated time of
	founding of a human population outside of Africa was 52,000 years
	(95% confidence interval: 36,00080,800 years).},

	Abstract = {Background
	
	The amount of genome-wide molecular data is increasing rapidly, as
	is interest in developing methods appropriate for such data. There
	is a consequent increasing need for methods that are able to efficiently
	simulate such data. In this paper we implement the sequentially Markovian
	coalescent algorithm described by McVean and Cardin and present a
	further modification to that algorithm which slightly improves the
	closeness of the approximation to the full coalescent model. The
	algorithm ignores a class of recombination events known to affect
	the behavior of the genealogy of the sample, but which do not appear
	to affect the behavior of generated samples to any substantial degree.
	
	Results
	
	We show that our software is able to simulate large chromosomal regions,
	such as those appropriate in a consideration of genome-wide data,
	in a way that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing
	coalescent algorithms.
	
	Conclusion
	
	This algorithm provides a useful resource for those needing to simulate
	large quantities of data for chromosomal-length regions using an
	approach that is much more efficient than traditional coalescent
	models.},

	Abstract = {The coalescent with recombination describes the distribution of genealogical
	histories and resulting patterns of genetic variation in samples
	of DNA sequences from natural populations. However, using the model
	as the basis for inference is currently severely restricted by the
	computational challenge of estimating the likelihood. We discuss
	why the coalescent with recombination is so challenging to work with
	and explore whether simpler models, under which inference is more
	tractable, may prove useful for genealogy-based inference. We introduce
	a simplification of the coalescent process in which coalescence between
	lineages with no overlapping ancestral material is banned. The resulting
	process has a simple Markovian structure when generating genealogies
	sequentially along a sequence, yet has very similar properties to
	the full model, both in terms of describing patterns of genetic variation
	and as the basis for statistical inference.},

	populations consist of chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry.
	For example, the genomes of African American individuals contain
	segments of both African and European ancestry, so that a specific
	location in the genome may inherit 0, 1, or 2 copies of European
	ancestry. Inferring an individual's local ancestry, their number
	of copies of each ancestry at each location in the genome, has important
	applications in disease mapping and in understanding human history.
	Here we describe HAPMIX, a method that analyzes data from dense genotyping
	chips to infer local ancestry with very high precision. An important
	feature of HAPMIX is that it makes use of data from haplotypes (blocks
	of nearby markers), which are more informative for ancestry than
	individual markers. Our simulations demonstrate the utility of HAPMIX
	for local ancestry inference, and empirical applications to African
	American and Mozabite data sets uncover important aspects of the

Using ancient and modern genome-wide data, we find that the ancestors of all present-day Native Americans, including Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago (KYA), and after no more than 8,000-year isolation period in Beringia. Following their arrival to the Americas, ancestral Native Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches around 13 KYA, one that is now dispersed across North and South America and the other is restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow resulted in some Native Americans sharing ancestry with present-day East Asians (including Siberians) and, more distantly, Australo-Melanesians. Putative `Paleoamerican' relict populations, including the historical Mexican Peric{\'u}es and South American Fuego-Patagonians, are not directly related to modern Australo-Melanesians as suggested by the Paleoamerican Model.},
